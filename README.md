# WordPress | Bedrock - Local development environment with Docker

Images used for the services:

- Wordpress: **wordpress:php8.1-fpm**
- Nginx: **nginx:stable-alpine**
- MariaDB: **mariadb:10.6**
- PhpMyAdmin: **phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin**

`wp-cli` and `xdebug` support included.

**For custom domain and ssl support, you will find the instructions at the end of this readme file.**

## Setup

1. Create `.env` file in root folder. See the example. Change the app name only!

2. Create `wordpress` folder in root. Bedrock will be installed here.

3. Run `set- a; source .env; docker-compose up --build`.

4. Create a new Bedrock project:

`bin/composer create-project roots/bedrock`

5. Unfortunately, Bedrock will create the project into a subfolder inside the `wordpress` folder, so you need to
   have the sub-folder content in the `wordpress` folder.

6. Make sure the `.env` credentials are correct (in wordpress folder) and match with the variable defined in `.env` in
   the root folder.

You can also customize the DB_PREFIX to increase security.
See "Change table prefixes" section further below to change prefix for tables in an existing wp database.

## WP CLI

Run `bin/wp` to enter the `wordpress` container. Simply run `wp` here.
The wp-cli is run by the www-data user, not by root (otherwise, it would be a security risk).

After testing some wp commands, it turns out that the user creation (wp user create ...) is not working and produces an
error. TODO: need to find cause. Maybe caused by Bedrock.

*Note: There are other useful shell commands in `bin` folder as well.*

## DB

Add your sql dump files into the db folder to be imported.

**Recommended sql import:**

Copy the sql file inside the mysql container:

`docker cp ./db/dump.sql container_id:/var/dump.sql`

After that, import the sql to the database inside the mysql container:

`mysql -u wordpress -p wordpress < /var/dump.sql`

Replace urls:

`wp search-replace 'https://example.com' 'http://localhost:8080/wp' --skip-columns=guid`

Or use PhpMyAdmin for a small database.

*Note: `bin/mysql-import` is not working.*

## PHP 8.0/8.1

There are deprecation and other warnings which will be eventually fixed in future WordPress and Bedrock releases...

## Change table prefixes

Generate queries for all tables:

```sql
SET
@database  = "wordpress";
SET
@oldprefix = "wp_";
SET
@newprefix = "customwp_";

SELECT concat(
               "RENAME TABLE ",
               TABLE_NAME,
               " TO ",
               replace(TABLE_NAME, @oldprefix, @newprefix),
               ';'
           ) AS "SQL"
FROM information_schema.TABLES
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = @database;
```

The code above resulted a list of sql queries. Run those:

```sql
RENAME
TABLE wp_actionscheduler_actions TO customwp_...
```

Very important: make sure to replace the prefixes everywhere needed (for example, `wp_user_roles`
-> `customwp_user_roles`)

```sql
UPDATE `customwp_usermeta`
SET meta_key = REPLACE(meta_key, 'wp_', 'customwp_')
WHERE meta_key LIKE 'wp_%';

SELECT *
FROM `customwp_options`
WHERE option_name LIKE 'wp_%';
```

## Other

This works better for Docker:
`wordpress/config/environments/development.php` -> `Config::define('FS_METHOD', 'direct');`

You may need to change permissions for wordpress folder. However, for production, use permission 755 for folders, and
644 for the files! 777 is a dangerous idea for production.

### Docker notes

For Linux, you may have to use sudo if your Docker is not configured to be used as a non-root user.

There are useful bash scripts in bin folder (bin/start, bin/down, etc.)

## Change Language

This is a bit tricky for Bedrock, but it works.

In composer.json changer these packages with your preferred language set like this:

```
"koodimonni-language/hu_hu": "*",
"koodimonni-plugin-language/woocommerce-hu_hu": "6.7.0",
```

to your language and versions.
See more at: https://wp-languages.github.io/
and https://discourse.roots.io/t/install-update-wordpress-languages-with-composer/2021

Copy the needed files to `wordpress/app/languages`. Also create themes and plugins sub-folders, and copy the right files
in the appropriate place.

`wordpress/vendor/koodimonni-language`

`wordpress/vendor/koodimonni-plugin-language`

`wordpress/vendor/koodimonni-theme-language`

## Custom domain and ssl certificate

Steps:

1. Set up your .env variables in root-folder .env

2. Create SSL certificate for your `APP_DOMAIN`

First:

You may need a different executable for **mkcert**. Copy your mkcert executable into `.docker/nginx` folder. Links:

- Windows: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#windows
- Mac: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#macos
- Linux: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert#linux or use the pre-build binaries (
  recommended): https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases

Then run `bin/setup-ssl`.

3. Add domain alias for `127.0.0.1` (e.g. in `/etc/hosts`)

4. Make sure `server_name` (there is 2 of them), ssl_certificate, and ssl_certificate_key is correct
   in `.docker/nginx/default-ssl.conf`! Although, the script will replace these values with the `APP_DOMAIN` if the
   default values are `wordpress.local` `.docker/nginx/default-ssl.conf`.

5. Now you can build the docker project:

`(set -a;source .env;docker-compose -f docker-compose-ssl.yml up --build)`

Continue with step #4 at the **Setup section**.


## Mailcatcher for local e-mail testing


1. See the `mailcatcher` in the docker-compose files.

2. Change `sendmail_path` in php.ini (php --ini). And reload php.ini by restarting services (`bin/restart`). Should be like this:

`sendmail_path = /usr/local/bin/mhsendmail`

[mhsendmail](https://github.com/mailhog/mhsendmail) - A sendmail replacement which forwards mail to an SMTP server.
In our case to Mailcatcher's SMTP local server.

3. Install `"wpackagist-plugin/wp-mail-smtp":"3.7.0"` with Composer inside the WordPress service.

4. Configure SMTP:

Setup "from address", and "name". Choose the "Other SMTP" option. 

Set these:
- SMTP Host: **mailcatcher**
- SMTP Port: **1025**

No need for encryption.
Auto TLS -> Off.
Authentication -> None.

5. Send out a test email.

6. Access Mailcatcher UI at localhost:1081


## Resolve WordPress loopback error

It is breaking the scheduled events, and can cause WP REST API errors as well.

A loopback request is simply a request that WordPress is trying to make to itself.
Loopback requests are used to run scheduled events (`wp-cron.php`).
Loopback requests need to function correctly in order to ensure your website remains stable

### 1. PHP-FPM pm.max_children should be at least 2.

Open the PHP-FPM's www.conf file (`/usr/local/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf` in our case) and check pm.max_children is set it at least to 2.

It should be correctly set by default though, but make sure it is okay.

"You must have at least two PHP-FPM processes running for Nginx, otherwise the loopback request ends up in a deadlock;
the site health request waits on the result of the loopback request, but Nginx cannot process the loopback request
until the site health request (that made the loopback request) terminates as there is only 1 PHP-FPM process running."
https://siliconshards.net/how-to-fix-loopback-request-failures-on-wordpress-for-nginx-with-php-fpm/

### 2. Point the IP of the Nginx container to the WordPress site URL

The bug is patched in v1.0.1.

Point the IP of the Nginx container to the WordPress site URL to make the loopback work!

All the networks are bridge networks by default (if not specified), and I use the default,
bridge network's IP address, because it is always the same: (for example, `172.17.0.1`). So there is no need to
modify the IP address everytime when restarting the docker network.

WordPress tries to loopback to itself via a domain name (`localhost:8080` in our case), and
the request should make it back to the Nginx Docker container. Otherwise, it will fail miserably.

Example:

```plain
wordpress
    extra_hosts:
      - localhost:172.17.0.1
      - host.docker.internal:host-gateway
```

#### 2.1. Get the bridge network's IP address

List the (running) Docker networks:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Get the details of your network including the IP address:

```bash
docker network inspect -v bridge
```
